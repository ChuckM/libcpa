Collecting the various STM32 functions that are useful in conjunction
with libopencm3. This means that I don't have to have a bunch of
otherwise "duplicate" files in all of my various project directories.
It also means when I fix something in say the uart driver I can use
it in all of my projects with a simple rebuild. All good stuff.
